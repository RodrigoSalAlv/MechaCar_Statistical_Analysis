The variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg dataset are the vehicle_weight and spolier_angle, this is because the slope of those two variables are nearly to zero, any changes in them will not affect the mpg result.

The slope cannot be considered as zero because, in this case, even the slightest change in any characteristic of the vehicle will gave us an mpg difference

If we assume that all this variables are the only ones that affect the mpg results, I would consider that this model will help to predict mpg of MechaCars prototypes effectively. In this cases I think that even tough the slope of every variable tends to zero, the minimum change will affect the mpg result
